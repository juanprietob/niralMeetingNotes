== For this week

1. GIT tutorial
2. SimpleITK + ITK

Create a repository in GIT that is available for us, we should have administrator privileges as well. 
You will create python scripts that use simpleITK to wrap different ITK filters. For example you can create a Gaussian filter, Shrink an image or filter, Dilate, Erode etc. 

For every filter you create you must create a different branch in your GIT repository. 
Once you finish an example, merge the branch to the master and continue with the next example. 

Push all of the changes to the upstream repository.
